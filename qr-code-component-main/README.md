## Overview

This is a landing page that displays a QR code with some simple text, the design should be accurate for a desktop view and for a mobile view.
### Screenshot

![Solution](design/Screenshot%20(33).png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

I really don't have a polished process but this are the steps I took:

1. Look at all the files in the accompanied folder.
2. Study design from images.
3. Code out html structure I felt best suited the mockup image.
4. style with css.
5. resize browser and keep adjusting styling until I feel that is the best I could get it.

### Built with


- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned and gained experience with CSS. Html is pretty straight forward to me but styling with CSS is where most of my weakness is as a software developer. Overall I believe I finally understand flex box pretty well and how that works. I think the next thing I need to learn is how to have elements scale when resizing a webpage.





### Continued development

There is still a lot for me to improve upon but these are a few that stood out with this challenge:

- I want to better understand how responsive web desgin works.
- Also want to get a firmer understanding of all the elements in css
