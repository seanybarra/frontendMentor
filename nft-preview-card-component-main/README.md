## Overview

This challenge was very similar to the qr-component challenge except it dealt with a little more features. It utilized the fact that the user would hover over certain elements on the page, so you would have to use psuedo selectors in css to implement that feature.

Overall I did a lot better on this challenge then the qr-component challenge.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

So I refined my process a little more eloquently this time around:
1. I reveiewed the design photos.
2. Started started coding out the HTML portion of  the project
3. Once I knew the HTML was correct and structured right, I started with the CSS
4. I desgined the mobile view first and then I finished up with the desktop last.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I got better at positioning the elements with flex-box, but I ultimately learned how to position things better on the page using the position selector in CSS
 ```css 
 body{
     position: absolute;
 }
 ```



### Continued development

As for now I believe this project is finished to the correct standard that was presented in the challenege so unless I get feedback saying that I did something wrong this is all I'll leave in this section
